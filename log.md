# Evening of 22 March

We listened to all ideas, and decided to try ideas with distributed stock.


# 24 March

Tasked out all stuff. Lack one developer to do the API.

Where asked how we solve ownership problem? Looked into other stocks - solve as they do. 

Variants - verified identity, stop selling goods, etc.

Another question raise - where is fintech? We do sell-buy and transactions. And we are trying to create new economy of many small brands and agents.


What we did?

- Distributed site hosted locally
- Upload via cross site request and our service into distributed storage
- Setup infrastructure to do ownership and sell-buy on blockchain, does not work yet.
