https://envato.com/

https://www.audioblocks.com

We do not solve original author problem now (we should just do econimically efficent alternativ), but when we have:

- Use same upporach as above markets
- User machine learning and third party services to detect issues (scan all p2p, including pirate networks)

Allow each person:

1. Create near zero cost web page which cannot go down (as easy as Facebook)
2. Do unique file upload which cannot be lost nor blocked
3. Allow to transfer rights of file from that page for currency
4. Person cannot be detached from ownership or cheated
5. There is no vendor lock in

# Our solutions for Owner workflow

1. Use internet build on content addressable durable peer to peer web and get immutable content link 
2. Store immutable link and ownership on blockchain
3. After sell, transfer crypto into fiat

#### Economics and money
- File is stored by many machines like p2p Dropbox
- If file is stored more than several times(popular for non commercial purporese) we can avoid storing
- We take money for `backup` (may still take money but no back because popular).

# Why? Socially

- laws enforcing of local storages and or audit are 
- directives to shut down sites cannot shutdown
- inability of arbitraty descision of selling provider to prevent person to sell
- avoid lock ins
- grows of "grey" p2p internet is trementoids and not yet monetised

## Cases
- Revolution in dictatorship country, most internet is blocked (p2p still works), photographer captures militant beats out eye ball of prosetant, publish and sell to western media whithin 10 minutes of happening
- Many digital artifcats became tradeable goods, while now stored. Upoaded means tradable.

# Why? Technically?

- Static Sites - next `Billion sites` (Jamstack, Netlifycms, Zeronet, Gitlab Pages, Github pages, SOLID)
- Global efficient storage with no copies (efficient) properly build for Web scale (we use IPFS, but there are Dat, torrent)
- Fast blockhains with propert entprise security (NEO with dBFT, .NET)
